#Containerization Assignment:

This document explains the test of existing setup,containerization decisions and implementation for the yolo project. It covers base image choices, Dockerfile directives, docker-compose networking & volumes, git workflow, run/debug instructions and container naming/tagging conventions.

#Setup

Clone the project git clone https://github.com/VivFifie/yolo.git

Once cloned cd to yolo directory run docker compose up the webiste comes up on http://localhost:3000

There are three services running: check using docker compose ps

Read the full docker compose file to understand the base images used for each service, the networking,service ports and volumes using: docker compose config

app-ip-mongo service:
Is using the official mongo image 
Runs on port 27017
Has data persistance setup on a docker volume yolo_app-mongo-data which is mounted to /data/db
The service the network app-net which is using bridge driver

brian-yolo-backend service:
Is using a pre-built image brianbwire/brian-yolo-backend:v1.0.0 which is using node in the implemetation I will beuild my own image.
Runs on port 5000
The service the network app-net which is using bridge driver
Has no persistant volume


brian-yolo-client service:

Is using a pre-built image brianbwire/brian-yolo-client:v1.0.0  in the implemetation I will beuild my own image.
Runs on port 3000
The service the network app-net which is using bridge driver
Has no persistant volume

Network:
The service use a common network app-net which uses the bridge driver. The network enables inter-container communication via service names.

##BACKEND:

#Base Image backend:

For the backend  containers, I used the node:18-alpine base image. Form research on the nodejs on the official docker images alpine is lightweight (100mb) and is secure. It has fast runtime and will improve build speed

#Backend Dockerfile:

- WORKDIR /usr/src/app : This sets the working directory inside the container.

- COPY package.json and COPY package-lock.json ./: This copies the dependancies required to run the source code

- RUN npm install : Install npm to be able to run the image

- COPY . . : This adds source code content into the container.

- EXPOSE 5000 : This exposes the port the backend service listens on.

- CMD ["npm", "start"] : Defines the containerâ€™s default startup command.


#Building and tagging the image:

docker build . -t vivfifie/yolo:v1.0.0

#Run test on the build image:

docker run -p 5000:5000 vivfifie/yolo:v1.0.0

#Push to docker hub:

docker push vivfifie/yolo:v1.0.0 

Final image size: 279MB


##FRONTEND:

#Base Image frontend:

Used node:18-alpine for consistency with the backend and to ensure a lightweight, secure build.

This image includes Node.js and npm, allowing both dependency installation and build steps to happen inside the container.

#Key Directives:

- WORKDIR /usr/src/app : Defines the working directory for the app inside the container.

- COPY package.json and COPY package-lock.json ./ : This copies the dependancies required to run the source code

- RUN npm install : Installs all project dependencies.

- COPY . . : This adds the REACT app source code content into the container.

- ENV NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider : This patch helps fix OpenSSL 3 issues in Node 18 due to unsuppoerted routines.

- RUN npm run build : Builds optimized production static files.

- RUN npm install -g serve : Installs a lightweight version on npm  for serving the built React app. Thus assisting reduce image size

- EXPOSE 3000 : Exposes the frontend port.

- CMD ["serve", "-s", "build", "-l", "3000"] : Starts the server on container startup.

#Debugging:

The patch on ENV NODE_OPTIONS was added after build attempt failed with error:

1.291 opensslErrorStack: [ 'error:03000086:digital envelope routines::initialization error' ], 1.291 library: 'digital envelope routines', 1.291 reason: 'unsupported', 1.291 code: 'ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED'

#Building and tagging the image:

docker build -t vivfifie/yolo-client:v1.1.1 .

#Run test on the build image:

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 vivfifie/yolo-client:v1.1.1

#Push to docker hub:

docker push vivfifie/yolo-client:v1.1.1

The optimized frontend image has s final size of 207 MB after multi-stage build optimization.
